/**
 * Three jobs, in order.
 *
 * 1. **Language.** Every route lives under `/[lang]`, so a request for `/books`
 *    has to be sent to `/en/books` or `/bn/books`. Which one is decided from
 *    the browser's own `Accept-Language`, because a Bengali reader typing the
 *    bare domain should land in Bengali. This runs once, on the way in; from
 *    then on the language is in the URL and every link carries it, so no
 *    further redirects happen while browsing.
 *
 * 2. **The library gate.** Nothing on these shelves opens without the password
 *    printed in the sponsored copy. Two routes are outside it (the door and
 *    the register), and everything else, catalogue included, needs a session.
 *
 * 3. **The admin guard.** This is the optimistic check the Next.js docs
 *    describe: it keeps everyone who typed the reader password out of the admin
 *    screens, and it costs nothing because the role is in a signed cookie that
 *    can be verified here without a data round trip. It is *not* the
 *    authorisation boundary: every Server Action calls `requireAdmin()`
 *    itself, because a POST never passes through a page.
 *
 * Note what this file cannot reach: anything under `/api` or with a file
 * extension is excluded by the matcher below, so the book files are not
 * protected from here. They are served by a route handler that checks the same
 * session itself: see `app/api/file/[slug]/route.ts`.
 */

/**
 * The pages that stay reachable without the password.
 *
 * `signin` has to be open or nobody could ever get in. `signup` is open
 * because it is the register rather than a gate: someone holding a copy
 * should be able to say where they are without first proving they have read
 * the page the password is printed on.
 *
 * `qr` is the proof sheet for the code printed in that copy, and it is open
 * here for a reason that costs nothing: the page itself answers 404 outside
 * development, so this entry only ever spares whoever is preparing the artwork
 * a sign-in on their own machine. Nothing is exposed on the live site.
 *
 * Everything else in the site is behind the password, catalogue included.
