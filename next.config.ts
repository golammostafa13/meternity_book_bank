 * architecture can absorb a 100k-visitors/minute spike from cache.
 *
 * Production hardening step: move the CSP to a Cloudflare Transform Rule /
 * Worker at the edge, where a nonce or hash can be injected into an already
 * cached response. Until then `script-src` needs 'unsafe-inline', because
 * Next's hydration payload and the pre-paint theme script are both inline.
 * Every other directive below is already locked down.

 * That is worth stating rather than leaving as an absence: it is the whole
